# User-SWINC-Mod-Pack-1
My first 5 mods, compiled into one bundle.

Installation

1 - Extract the folders from the .zip
2 - Move all folders to the Mods folder inside the Software Inc directory.
3 - For E-Drinks and AI Software mods, extract the mod folder from inside the folders and put that folder into the Mods folder.
4 - Remove the original E-Drinks and AI Software folders so that the extracted folder is the only folder from them.
